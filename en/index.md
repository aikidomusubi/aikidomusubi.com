Musubi Aikido Cultural Association (__Aikido Musubi__), founded in 2008, is a self-managed, non-profit association that promotes aikido in Badalona. We offer aikido classes for adults and children every day in our dojo (_Av. D’Alfons XIII, 351 08918 Badalona, ​​Barcelona_).

__Aikido Musubi__ aims to promote aikido as a way of improvement and self-development through a sincere and constant practice based on respect for others. Through techniques, we contribute to physical, mental, and spiritual development in addition to self-confidence and compassion for opponents.

It is our wish that those who practice at __Aikido Musubi__ can experience the depth and enjoyment of aikido through daily training in an appropriate environment (dojo) shared by students and other fellow aikidoka.

If you want to start training aikido, [contact us]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/contact/) or [visit our dojo]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/access-information/). Registration is free and is open all year.

We love to share our experience and that is why we welcome everyone who wants to join our association.

The philosophy of __Aikido Musubi__ is based on the precepts established by the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, and inherited by the second and third doshu, as well as the masters (_shihan_) of the Aikido World Headquarters, the [Hombu Dojo](http://www.aikikai.or.jp/).

__Aikido Musubi__ is part of [Aikido Arashi Group](http://aikidoarashigroup.com/), which maintains a direct link with the Hombu Dojo through the master Miyamoto Tsuruzo (8th dan). In addition, we participate in aikido courses and seminars throughout Europe and the world conducted by renowned teachers; and we regularly travel to Tokyo to visit and train at the Hombu Dojo.

Our dojo is a large and open space dedicated exclusively to the practice and teaching of martial arts. It is supervised and managed by the technical director and instructors of the association; but being the responsibility of everyone (not just the instructors or the teacher), it is maintained and cared for by the students.

The dojo is an ideal place to deepen the study and understanding of martial arts, and to meet all kinds of people regardless of age, sex and occupation.

Aikido is a non-competitive Japanese martial art developed in the early 20th century by Morihei Ueshiba (1883-1969). It is based on other traditional Japanese martial arts, mainly _Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu_, and uses flexible, natural, and highly effective movements to evade, redirect, or neutralise attacks using the opponent's force.

The practice of aikido is an arduous physical training that is based on the repetition of exercises, maintaining a good balance between the left and the right, and alternating between the performance of techniques and their acceptance. Aikido is not only good for health, but it also develops self-confidence naturally for daily life.

You can start practicing aikido at any time, regardless of age or physical condition; both men and women, from adults to children.

At __Aikido Musubi__, we offer classes that are suitable for inexperienced people apart from regular classes. During a class, the instructor-in-charge and veteran students accompany and guide beginners safely.
